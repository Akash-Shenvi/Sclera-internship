### Content
I learned the fundamentals of Java programming. I gained an understanding of Java’s key features and the roles of JVM, JRE, and JDK, along with the basic structure of a Java program. I learned about classes, the `main()` method, and how Java code is compiled and executed. I explored variables, data types, operators, and control statements such as if-else conditions and loops. I also studied type casting and type conversion, basic data structures including one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, user input handling, basic Math class functions, and solved simple problems like a calculator program.

### Content
I explored the core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java, focusing on classes and objects and how classes act as blueprints for object creation. I understood that multiple objects of the same class maintain separate data and learned how Java manages memory using stack and heap. I learned about encapsulation and how it protects data by controlling access through methods. I gained clarity on abstraction by understanding how it exposes only essential features while hiding internal details. I also learned about constructors and their role in initializing objects in a valid state. Finally, I studied static members and how they belong to the class and are shared across all instances.
