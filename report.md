### Content
I learned the fundamentals of Java programming. I gained an understanding of Java’s key features and the roles of JVM, JRE, and JDK, along with the basic structure of a Java program. I learned about classes, the `main()` method, and how Java code is compiled and executed. I explored variables, data types, operators, and control statements such as if-else conditions and loops. I also studied type casting and type conversion, basic data structures including one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, user input handling, basic Math class functions, and solved simple problems like a calculator program.

### Content
I explored the core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java, focusing on classes and objects and how classes act as blueprints for object creation. I understood that multiple objects of the same class maintain separate data and learned how Java manages memory using stack and heap. I learned about encapsulation and how it protects data by controlling access through methods. I gained clarity on abstraction by understanding how it exposes only essential features while hiding internal details. I also learned about constructors and their role in initializing objects in a valid state. Finally, I studied static members and how they belong to the class and are shared across all instances.

### Content
I Covered advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java, including refactoring techniques to improve code structure and readability. Learned method overloading for handling different inputs using the same method name. Studied inheritance, the Object class, constructor chaining using super(), access modifiers, method overriding, upcasting and downcasting, and runtime polymorphism. Also gained understanding of abstract classes, final classes, deep inheritance, and why Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces instead of classes.
