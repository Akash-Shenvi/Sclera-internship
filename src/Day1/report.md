I learned the fundamentals of Java programming. I gained an understanding of Java’s key features and the roles of JVM, JRE, and JDK, along with the basic structure of a Java program. I learned about classes, the `main()` method, and how Java code is compiled and executed. I explored variables, data types, operators, and control statements such as if-else conditions and loops. I also studied type casting and type conversion, basic data structures including one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, user input handling, basic Math class functions, and solved simple problems like a calculator program.
