### Content
I studied the fundamentals of the Java Collections Framework, including its overall structure and purpose. I learned why the Iterable interface is required and how it enables objects to be traversed using loops. I also understood the roles of the Iterator interface and its methods like hasNext() and next() for safe element traversal. Additionally, I explored the Collection interface as the root of List, Set, and Queue. This session helped me understand how Java efficiently manages and processes groups of objects.


I implemented the Book CRUD APIs as part of the Spring Boot task using Web, Database, and Spring Data JPA dependencies. I completed create, read, update, and delete operations for the Book entity and ensured proper database interaction through JPA repositories.
