### Content
I went through the Java Exceptions and Generics topics using the video modules and got a clear understanding of how exception handling works in real programs. I learned about different types of exceptions, their hierarchy, and how to handle errors using try-catch, finally, throwing, rethrowing, and custom exceptions. Along with that, I studied generics and understood why they are needed, how they improve type safety, and how they help in writing reusable code. I also learned about generic classes, methods, multiple type parameters, wildcards, constraints, and type erasure. Overall, this learning helped me feel more confident in writing cleaner, safer, and more flexible Java code.

I implemented the Author CRUD APIs as part of the Spring Boot task using Web, Database, and Spring Data JPA dependencies. I completed create, read, update, and delete operations for the Author entity and handled database interactions properly. This work sets the foundation for integrating book relationships and implementing the remaining endpoints like average rating, pricing, and pagination.
