I Covered advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java, including refactoring techniques to improve code structure and readability. Learned method overloading for handling different inputs using the same method name. Studied inheritance, the Object class, constructor chaining using super(), access modifiers, method overriding, upcasting and downcasting, and runtime polymorphism. Also gained understanding of abstract classes, final classes, deep inheritance, and why Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces instead of classes.
