### Content
I explored the core Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java, focusing on classes and objects and how classes act as blueprints for object creation. I understood that multiple objects of the same class maintain separate data and learned how Java manages memory using stack and heap. I learned about encapsulation and how it protects data by controlling access through methods. I gained clarity on abstraction by understanding how it exposes only essential features while hiding internal details. I also learned about constructors and their role in initializing objects in a valid state. Finally, I studied static members and how they belong to the class and are shared across all instances.
