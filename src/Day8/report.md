Today I learned about functional interfaces in Java and how they can be implemented using lambda expressions to write cleaner and more concise code. I understood the difference between anonymous inner classes and lambdas, and how lambdas reduce boilerplate. I studied built-in functional interfaces like Consumer, Supplier, Function, Predicate, BinaryOperator, and UnaryOperator from the java.util.function package. I also learned about function composition, consumer chaining, and variable capture in lambdas. Finally, I explored Java Streams and understood the difference between imperative and functional programming styles.
