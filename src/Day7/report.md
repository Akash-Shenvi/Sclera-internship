Today I completed the modules on the List interface, Comparable and Comparator interfaces, Queue interface, Set interface, Hash Tables, and the Map interface, followed by the summary session. I understood how different collection types work in Java, their internal behavior, and when to use each based on requirements like ordering, uniqueness, and key-value mapping. I also learned the difference between Comparable and Comparator for sorting objects and strengthened my understanding of data structures used in real-time applications. Overall, this helped me gain a clearer and more practical understanding of the Java Collections Framework.
